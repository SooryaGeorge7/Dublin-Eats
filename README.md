### **Agile Planning**

1.	User stories are implemented which identifies the necessary features and functions of the website.
2.	Prioritzie User stories from high importance to least important. This is done using labels such as “must-haves”, “should-haves”, “could-haves”
3.	Categorize user stories further my having labels such as documentations for README and TESTING user stories.
4.	Break userstories into smaller tasks .

The must-have user stories were prioritized first. Certain other user stories were implemented based on time and complexity. Kanan board for the project can be viewed here
